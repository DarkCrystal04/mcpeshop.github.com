<P><B><U>What were changes in v.1.16.10?
<BR>
New Minecraft PE 1.16.10 release for Android you can download here. Mojang unfortunately nothing added and added only one bug. This bug connected with trading screen slot, it didn't work correctly. Nevertheless I think that it is important bug and you have to update your game version to new one. Mojang publicized also about important changes that they will not support old devices.

What important news about Minecraft PE for mobile phone?
<br>
Today developer showed new Minecraft PE update, but also wrote about some news. From october 2020 Minecraft PE will not support low devices with less than 768MB of RAM. Minecraft PE is improving and get more productivity. That is why requirements should be high. If you have old phones you have to think about buying new, modern one.
